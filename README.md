## Installation

Simply click the link to deploy the work day planner application.

## Usage

The purpose of this application is to help users plan out their work days. At the top of the application the current day and date will be shown. With time blocks from 9am to 5pm, users are able to click the text areas and type in their list of tasks to complete during different hours in the day. Tasks will be saved when the save button is clicked and will persist through browser refreshes, as they are saved in the localStorage. Time blocks that representing hours passed are have a gray background, the time block representing the current hour is red, and the times that are later in the day are green. Each day the tasks for the previous day will be cleared and users will be given a clean planner to begin their new day.
